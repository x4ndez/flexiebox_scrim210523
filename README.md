This is not a color changer.  Each click will bring you to a different item in the flexbox via window.ScrollTo().  This was a fun little exercise because I learned about the window object, and learned that querySelectorAll doesn't select all elements of that class, but only the first; it just returns an array which I applied a for loop.  What I actually wanted to do with this exercise was to make a website that would scroll smoothly to each item in the flexbox.  I can already do this with a vertical flexbox with css coding, but I wanted to see if I could do it with a 2*2 flexbox... I know there's a way! I just haven't figured it out in the little time I had!
